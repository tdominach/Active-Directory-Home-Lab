# Active Directory Home Lab

This home lab is a personal project which I have used to learn the basics of Active Directory. My main goals were to become familar with performing administrative task in a work enviroment, automating these task with PowerShell scripts, and developing good AD management pratices.

# How was my home lab made?
I virtualized a Windows network enviorment by using VMware's virtual network adapter feature to connect multiple VMs to one another on an internal virtual network. This includes a Windows Server 2019 VM which serves as a domain controller and Windows 10 VMs as client computers. A detailed diagram can be seen below.
